This repository hold the files used to complete assignment 1 of the Applied Bioinformatics Module.

Not all of the files have suitable commit comments as they were commited quickly, and could not be modified once committed the first time.
Please refer to this readme file for a description of each of the files in this repository.

Part 1 files = Ringbuffer
* The signal.txt file holds the data that we want to smooth.
* The ringbuffer.py creates the ringbuffer and send the results to the text file, smoothed.txt
* The smoothed.txt file hold the results of the ringbuffer
* The plotgraph.txt file contains the commands used in R to plot the results of the ringbuffer
* The graph60.pdf file displays the graph of the results of the ringbuffer, the graph is very similar to a Sine graph.

Part 2 files = Length
* NC_002695.1 file was a download of the E.coli 0157 genome from the GEO website.
* NC_002695.1.fasta was the fasta file containing the genome sequence of the E.coli 0157 genome.
* The record_lengths.py was the Biopython script used to find the 3 longest E.coli gene sequences and print the results into the longest_genes.fasta file.
* The longest_genes.fasta file hold the 3 longest gene sequences from the E.coli 0157 genome.
